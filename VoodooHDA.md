# VoodooHDA Preference Pane Settings #

I'm currently using Slice/Autumnrain's edited VoodooHDA.kext v261.

This driver has a few problems, such as the internal mic being on and fully monitored. That's a great feature if you want to do some karaoke, but that's not very practical now is it?

Here are the prefpane settings that I use to have the input/output work as intended.

# Input - Speaker #
